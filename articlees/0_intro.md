Introduction
============

Welcome to {name} !

In this series of articles you'll learn how to build a trading platform from A to Z.

We'll cover multiple aspects such as (but not limited to) programming (using both python and C++ and some asembly), network and operating system aspects and low latency programming.

We'll build our system to trade in the cryptocurrencies markets.

Since I come from more of a computer science background, this book will be focused more on the technical aspect of trading (building the trading platform and strategies) than the trading aspect.

We'll build simple strategies but we'll try to be as fast as we can to make them work/profitable

The system
----------

[insert a diagram of high level system]

The stack
---------

We'll use the following technical stack:

* Python
* C++
* Linux (Ubuntu)
* Timedatabase Serie (Influx DB)

Why crypto ?
-----------
I'm not really a pro (or cons) crypto currency guy, the choice is soly motivated by the huge abondunce of data provided for free by most crypto exchanges (compared to more traditional stock markets where the data is usually quite expensive). This will still translate fairly easily to more traditional financial instruments such as futures or stocks.
